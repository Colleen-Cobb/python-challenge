# python-challenge

## Overview

This project utilizes python in visual studio code to evaluate financial records as well as vote-counting processes. Python scripts are attached to this repository for folders 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll', respectively.
This project identifies the users capabilities in outputting specific values in VS code while using a variety of python functions and assigning a outpath for analysis review. 

## Analysis

### PyBank
THis python script uncovers the 'Total Months', 'Total" (net total), 'Average Change', 'Greatest Increase in Profits', and 'Greatest Decrease in Profits'. The viewer will be able to easily view these values in the output file and make conclusions based on the financial analysis results. This script is useful in determining variables through a large data set over many months.

### PyPoll
This python script analyzies a large set of poll data to  uncover the 'Total Votes', a list of candidates with their assigned percentage of votes as well as total number of votes won, and 'Winner'. The results of this script allows the viewer to determine which candidates received a certain portion of votes in various counties.
